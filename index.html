            <h3>What is TechNova?</h3>
            <p>
              TechNova Solutions is a growing Jordanian AI startup specializing
              in innovative and ethical technology solutions. As part of its
              commitment to professional development and social impact, TechNova
              was contracted by the National Innovation Hub (NIH) to design and
              deliver a training program titled “AI for Good: Ethics,
              Communication, and Collaboration.” This training program aims to
              support government organizations in building future-ready teams
              capable of working effectively in Smart City projects. The
              training is designed for 15 government analysts and engineers from
              NIH. It focuses on enhancing participants’ interpersonal and
              professional skills, particularly in communication, teamwork,
              ethical awareness in artificial intelligence, and effective time
              management under pressure. The program is delivered as a three-day
              training sprint spread across four weeks, ensuring flexibility
              while meeting project constraints. The main objectives of this
              training are to improve communication between working teams,
              promote a clear understanding of ethical considerations in AI,
              strengthen collaboration across departments, and enhance
              participants’ ability to prioritize tasks and manage time
              effectively. By combining structured planning, interactive
              learning activities, and professional communication practices,
              TechNova Solutions aims to deliver a high-impact training
              experience that supports both individual skill development and
              organizational performance.
